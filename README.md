# ILR Faculty and Staff Data Aggegation

These scripts pull and aggregate ILR faculty and staff data from Cornell's directory via LDAP, from the legacy web-based directory of ILR's old web site, and from Activity Insight.

Data are formatted and streamlined for consumption by the Drupal Feed module for inclusion in the Profile content type.
